## Features:

- Fully customizable colors via [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk)
- Easy config persistence handling via [conf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conf)
- Compile to binary via [pkg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg)
- Easily make HTTP requests using [got](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got/v/11.8.6)
- Fully customizable menus (no external libs!)

## Why:

- I was tired of using libs like [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), [enquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enquirer), & [vorpal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vorpal) **(all great libraries!)** for my basic CLI apps as I do not need many of their options, and I enjoy having 100% control over the way the CLI behaves when it comes to selection, colors, navigation and such.

#### **Install Dependencies**
